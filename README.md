# DNA-sequencing
First python project which involves creation of a DNA sequencer(because I am interested in bioinformatics) 
My initial goal is to read a DNA sequence text file, count the number of nitrogenous bases and the frequency of each. I also want to find the percentage of GC.
My aim is to build up on this project and add more as I gain more knowledge
